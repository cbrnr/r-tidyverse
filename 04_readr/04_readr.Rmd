## Prerequisites
In this chapter, we will use the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package to import rectangular data stored in plain text files. So far, we have only worked with example data already available in R, but at some point we need to import our own datasets. Unfortunately, it is rarely the case that these datasets are already tidy. Instead, real-world data may contain typos and/or inconsistent notations, combine multiple variables in one column, use multiple columns for a single variable, and so on.

In addition to readr, the Tidyverse also provides packages for importing data from other statistical software. In particular, the [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) package supports SPSS, Stata, and SAS formats, whereas [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) imports data stored in Excel sheets.

We start with importing plain text files:

```{r}
library(readr)
```

## Plain text files
Plain text files contain only text (letters, numbers, punctuation, and other special characters). They can be opened by any text editor on almost any platform. Therefore, storing data in a plain text file is often a viable option unless there are of hundreds of thousands of rows and columns. Such large datasets would take up a lot of disk space when stored as plain text, so other more specialized binary formats (not covered in this workshop) should be preferred.

In many cases, data can be represented as a table consisting of rows and columns. Therefore, our goal is to convert rectangular data from its text representation to a data frame in R.

Here's the contents of *mtcars.csv*, an example rectangular plain text file that comes with readr (you can find its location on your computer with `readr_example("mtcars.csv")`):

Apparently, this file has a header row containing variable names, and columns are separated by commas.

## The `readr` functions
The most generic function for reading rectangular data is called `read_delim()`. It has parameters to set the column delimiter, decimal mark, missing values, whether or not there is a header row, and so on. Other functions include `read_csv()`, `read_tsv()`, and `read_csv2()`, which are special cases with predefined values for some common file formats. We'll showcase how readr functions work using `read_delim()`, because all functions behave very similarly.

### The `file` and `delim` arguments
The first argument is always the file name you want to import. The second argument specifies the column separator used in the particular file. For example, if you wanted to load *mtcars.csv* shown in the previous example, you could use this function call to store the contents of the file in a data frame `df`:

```{r message=FALSE}
df <- read_delim(readr_example("mtcars.csv"), ",")
```

However, data files are usually located in the current working directory. This allows us to specify the file name without the complete path as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read_delim("mtcars.csv", ",")
```

We could use `read_csv()` to import this file, which saves us passing the column separator argument:

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("mtcars.csv")
```

Instead of a file name, you can also pass a character vector as the first argument:

```{r}
read_delim("A,B,C\n1.1,1.3,-2.0\n5,6.3,-1.8", ",")
```

This is useful to quickly generate some toy data. Note that `\n` corresponds to a line break.

Here is an example of data separated by semi-colons. To import it, we need to set `delim=";"` accordingly.

```{r}
read_delim("A;B;C\n1.1;1.3;-2.0\n5;6.3;-1.8", ";")
```

Whatever the format of the file may be, the result is always a data frame.

### Other useful arguments
If the file does not contain a header row, we need to specify `col_names=FALSE`:

```{r}
read_delim("1.1,1.3,-2.0\n5,6.3,-1.8", ",", col_names=FALSE)
```

In this case, `read_delim()` generates column names automatically (`X1`, `X2`, and `X3`).

English-speaking countries use a point as the decimal separator. This is also the case for most programming languages (including R), for example:

```{r}
4.1
```

In contrast, many other countries (including Austria and Germany) use a comma to separate whole and decimal digits. Therefore, the number 4.1 would be written as 4,1. To import numerical data stored in this format, we need to set the `locale` argument accordingly:

```{r}
read_delim("A;B;C\n1,1;1,3;-2,0\n5;6,3;-1,8", ";", locale=locale(decimal_mark=","))
```

The resulting data frame is identical to the previous example where we used the regular English number format. It is also worth noting that a file cannot have both column and decimal separators to be the same character. This is why the previous example used semi-colons to delimit columns.
